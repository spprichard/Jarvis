# Jarvis
The thing that does all the things:
First iteration would be a CLI that answer some basic questions. The goal here is that Jarvis would provide mwe the information I want, when prompted. A nice to have at this step would be the storeage of meta-data about the questions asked. That would be like time of day, questions asked in 1 session, etc. The hope here is that this information would be used to help predict when I will ask a future question, and given me the information I want before I ask. This could start as desktop notifications, then evolove into a always on desktop app. 


# Ideas

## G-Suite integration, starting with calander.
"Jarvis how long till my next meeting"
  - Show me a count down till my next meeting.
"Jarvis, how many meetings do I have today?"
  - Same domain, different intent with different expectation for answer.

## Lunch.email
"Jarvis, what's for lunch"
  - Integrate with lunch.email to show me what is for lunch
  
  
##  Integration with school related things like assignments, grades, projects, payments, etc.
 "Jarvis, when is my next assignment due?"
  - This would requre integration with t-sqaure, or the new Canvas site. 
  - Jarvis would have to have knowledge of assignments, projects, etc
  - There may or may not be an api for this. I am going to assume there is not
